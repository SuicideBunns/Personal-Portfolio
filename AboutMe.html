                <p>
                    I am a second year student who is studying at University of Cordillera.
                    My passion lies in coding and creating innovative codes.
                    I started to study coding because I was amazed on how people make
                    websites, games, etc.
                </p>


                <p>
                    I also had created a Python game like Tower of Hanoi and Card Deck
                    Shuffling. I also can create a basic HTML and CSS website.
                    Today I am very happy to help my fellow students who are having
                    troubles in their projects.
